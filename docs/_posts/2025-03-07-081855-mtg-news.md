The Magic: The Gathering video game, originally released in 1993, was a phenomenally successful trading card game that has spawned a popular lifestyle brand of collectible card games. Now, the video game is being adapted into a movie in the same vein as the popular “Harry Potter” movies and other “Harry Potter” films. The “Godzilla” movie is another exciting possibility. As the story goes, Universal Studios has the backing to produce a massive film based on the trading card game.
