Card set developer Magic: The Gathering has kicked off a new series of Magic: The Gathering miniatures called Aetherdrift. As with the previous Wild Frontier set, the miniatures come from the Aether Basin, a magical area in the mountains of Zendikar that has been waiting for the players of Magic for generations. They are exotic sights to behold and can be disassembled to be used in the deck building of smaller formats.
