“Magic: The Gathering” is a trading card game, a growing phenomenon that has been played by millions of people around the world since 1993. The card game is played by collecting and trading cards to build up a winning team or team of space marines. The title has a rich history and has featured in a variety of popular films and TV series. Hasbro is about to launch a new generation of trading card games and this time the company is focusing its efforts on the film and TV side of the business. The company has a rich history of getting into the gaming world with entertainment properties such as Barbie, the WWE and “Wii Fit.” Hasbro is also in the business of producing toys, books and board games. So it makes perfect sense that the company would get into the gaming business as well. Hasbro is hoping to build a whole franchise around “Magic: The Gathering.”
