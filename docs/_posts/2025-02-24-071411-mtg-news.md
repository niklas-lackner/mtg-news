The new booster set, Aetherdrift, will introduce a new mechanic called “wild” cards, which let you play cards that are not necessarily from a set, or even in a deck, but are instead legal to play from the deck. The new set, which releases in July, will also be adding new modes to Magic so you can play with the cards you want to, but can’t, play.
