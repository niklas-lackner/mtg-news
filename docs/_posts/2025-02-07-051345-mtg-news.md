Aetherdrift is a brand-new set, just like the previous ones. In fact, it's so new, it's still in the process of being designed. But that doesn't mean you have to sit around and wait for it. You can get into gear right away with the Aetherdrift Standard Deckbuilding Game, a brand-new set of cards that'll give you a sense of what the new Standard looks and feels like.
