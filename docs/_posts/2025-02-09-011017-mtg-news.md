Aetherdrift is a deck-building game. And it is, in a sense, also a card-drawing game. Itâ€™s essentially a round-based Magic game, with a deck of cards that you build and then discard as you see fit. Even better, that deck can be built by a group of people at once. But you need to be careful: The game requires players to be judicious with what they draw.
