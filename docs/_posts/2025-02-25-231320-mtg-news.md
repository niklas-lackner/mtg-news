In the coming months, there are many things we can expect from Magic: The Gathering. We can expect the game to appear in the films of Legendary film writer David S. Goyer and director James Gunn. We can expect the game to appear on television shows including “Magic: The Gathering,” the critically acclaimed new show from Hasbro and their “Dino Babies” partner, Saban Brands.
