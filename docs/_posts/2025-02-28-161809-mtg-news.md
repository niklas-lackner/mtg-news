The Magic: The Gathering trading card game is a remarkable form of modern design for a lot of reasons. The game has inspired some of the most successful games of all time, which include Magic: The Gathering Online and Magic: The Gathering Arena, the two most popular and best-selling card games on the PC and mobile platforms, respectively. It has also inspired a slew of imitators, including Magic: The Gathering Online, Card Collection, Magic: The Gathering Arena, etc. But it’s also been a lightning rod for controversy, with people both for and against it, from the game’s creators to its players. Now it’s getting a major movie and TV adaptation.
