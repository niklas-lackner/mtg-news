Aetherdrift is the next Magic: The Gathering expansion. It’s a new set, and it’s new. The core mechanic is a new mechanic, called Wild. The art, like the core mechanic, is new and different. The set will be released in April, so it means both the core mechanic and art will be available to play with before then.
