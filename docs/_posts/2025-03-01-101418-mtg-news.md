“Magic: The Gathering,” the trading card game played in basements around the globe since 1993, is set for major film and TV adaptations from Legendary Entertainment and Hasbro. The toy maker and Hollywood mini-major behind the “Godzilla” and “Dune” franchises has teamed up with Legendary to bring to life the first film based on the card game’s most popular set, Magic: The Gathering: Arena, which came out in 2014. Legendary Entertainment and Hasbro announced today that the company will partner on a live-action and animated TV series based on the global best-selling Magic: The Gathering collectible card game and its wildly popular trading card game, “Magic: The Gathering: Arena.” The project is the first to be based on Magic: The Gathering. Legendary Entertainment and Hasbro will co-produce the series, with Legendary Entertainment handling distribution and Hasbro providing the game’s intellectual property. The series will be produced by Legendary Entertainment’s Mandalay Television and will be written by Matt Tolmach, who’s penned several “The Walking Dead” television episodes.
