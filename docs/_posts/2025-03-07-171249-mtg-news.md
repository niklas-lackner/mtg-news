“Magic: The Gathering,” the trading card game played in basements around the globe since 1993, is set for major film and TV adaptations from Legendary Entertainment and Hasbro. The toy maker and Hollywood mini-major behind the “Godzilla” and “Dune” franchises are teaming up for a live-action adaptation of the wildly popular card game that has been played in private homes for decades. Legendary Entertainment and Hasbro have agreed to develop a “Magic: The Gathering” TV series and films, and will co-finance and cast the shows. The two companies have been working together since 2016, when Legendary Entertainment dropped the project. The two companies have been teaming up on a number of other television projects as well, including “The Walking Dead” and “The Walking Dead: Season 11.”
