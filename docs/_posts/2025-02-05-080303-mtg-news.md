These days, it seems like Christmas is almost the only time of year when people have the chance to have fun with Magic: The Gathering. And maybe that's a good thing.

The holidays are a great time to not only play Magic: The Gathering, but also to roast your friends. And not just for the fun of it, either. Here's a look at the various events that are happening this holiday season.

The Standard Side

Legacy Tour

The Legacy Tour is a special event that is being run this year by Wizards of the Coast. It takes place on December 1, and will feature a series of events dedicated to the legacy of the game's older formats. The event is a big event, and will feature a variety of appearances by players and celebrities.

The Legacy Tour is a great opportunity to play Magic with people who are interested in the older formats. While the format will also appear in the Pro Tour, the Legacy Tour is the only event dedicated to it.

The Legacy Tour will have various appearances, including Stephenie Meyer, who will be playing a special event on December 1. There will also be appearances from people who have played in the Legacy Pro Tour.

Wizards also has a special Legacy-themed deck in its store. To find this deck, go to Magic.com/store.

Pro Tour

The Pro Tour will feature a variety of events, including a deck-building competition, a draft, and a side event.

The deck-building competition will feature players that played in the Legacy Tour.

The draft will feature the Legacy decks, and will be limited to one deck per player.
