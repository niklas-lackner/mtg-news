“Magic: The Gathering,” the trading card game played in basements around the globe since 1993, is set for major film and TV adaptations from Legendary Entertainment and Hasbro. The toy maker and Hollywood mini-major behind the “Godzilla” and “Dune” franchises is set to produce animated series based on its popular card game. The two companies have been working on the material for at least two years, and Legendary has already produced a 40-episode animated series.
