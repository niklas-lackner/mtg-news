As we mentioned before, Aetherdrift will introduce a new set of Magic cards with the number of cards in the set capped at forty-two. We also now know that the new set will be called Aetherdrift and will be a double-expansion set with both Ravnica and Innistrad. The first expansion of Aetherdrift is called Aetherdrift: Beyond the Veil and will introduce new lands, spells, and creatures.
