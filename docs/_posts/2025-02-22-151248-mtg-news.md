Aetherdrift, which lands in stores in just a few weeks, has a dozen cards with wild new abilities that you don’t see in standard, plus a couple of wild new art cards. It’s a powerful set for the everyday Magic player, with lots of tournament-competitive decks and a new mechanic that will make competitive play more exciting. The other side of the coin is that Aetherdrift will be widely accessible for casual players looking to pick up the game.
