“Magic: The Gathering,” the trading card game played in basements around the globe since 1993, is set for major film and TV adaptations from Legendary Entertainment and Hasbro. The toy maker and Hollywood mini-major behind the “Godzilla” and “Dune” franchises have started work on a TV series to be produced by Legendary and Hasbro. The TV series will feature footage from Wizards of the Coast’s in-house studio, but will also be partially financed by Hasbro.
