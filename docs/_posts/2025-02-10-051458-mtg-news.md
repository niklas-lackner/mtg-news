We’ve been waiting a long time for Aetherdrift, and now that the second set of Magic: The Gathering booster packs is finally here, the wait is over. Aetherdrift is a new set in Magic‘s Legacy format, with all-new cards for five of the eight tribes. The base set includes three new tribes — Magus, Thief, Warlock — and five new planeswalkers, including two new planeswalkers from the plane Tethethin, a new planeswalker from the plane of Aether, and a new planeswalker from the plane of Zendikar.
