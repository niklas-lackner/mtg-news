Aetherdrift, coming in the autumn, is not quite the traditional Magic storyline. Itâ€™s not the story of the protagonist chasing his nemesis, nor is it the story of a hero who finally defeats his nemesis. Instead, Aetherdrift is the story of a chaotic, power-hungry family, who, with the help of a pair of powerful artifacts, will eventually destroy the entire plane of Magic.
