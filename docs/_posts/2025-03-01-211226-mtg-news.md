The movie and TV universes surrounding “Magic: The Gathering” have been on the rise for years. But the “Magic: The Gathering” movie and TV Universe has always been a little on the small side. It was exciting when “Magic: The Gathering” was first announced in 2005, but with few exceptions, the only TV and movie adaptations of the game have been in the form of a casual show on the Disney Channel, or the comic book miniseries “Magic: The Gathering: The Game,” which was published to the “Magic: The Gathering” app as a free PDF.
