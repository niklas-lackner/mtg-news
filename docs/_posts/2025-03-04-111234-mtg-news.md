There’s only one Magic: The Gathering, the card-playing game that’s played by millions of people around the globe. It’s not a movie or a TV series like “The Lord of the Rings.” The game is about creating a deck of cards, called a deck, with a theme and a narrative. It’s a little like “The Lord of the Rings,” but with cards instead of stones. The primary card-drawing game in Magic is a duel between players. The game is played with a deck of cards called a “deck,” which is made up of cards called “tasks.” A deck is a collection of cards that represent various themes and stories. Each deck has a hidden theme and story that the players have to uncover.
