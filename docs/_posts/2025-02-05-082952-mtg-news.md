The Wild booster set is packed with exciting new cards, including some that will only be published as Limited Edition. I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that the vast majority of the Magic community is not aware of the exciting new set that was just announced. That’s unfortunate, because it’s such an incredible set, and I think a lot of people would be very interested in knowing more about it.
