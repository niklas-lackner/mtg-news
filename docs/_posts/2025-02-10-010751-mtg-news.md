Aetherdrift is a cool concept. It combines the best things from Magicâ€˜s past and future, and paves the way for a new and improved series of cards. Just as with the old cards, the deck is balanced around the idea of having a variety of cards that can be used to bring your deck to an exciting and unexpected end.
