I have to say, I’m a little disappointed in my luck. I had a really good run with this deck this weekend and a lot of the cards I wanted to play were left out. I didn’t get to play some of my favorite cards like Hymn to Tourach and Deathrite Shaman. I got to play a bunch of cards that I would have liked to have had (or wanted to have, but didn’t get to play). I also got to play a bunch of cards that I wouldn’t have liked to have played. I’m not even going to go into the games I didn’t win, because that’s me getting down on myself, but as I said, I didn’t get to play all of my favorite cards. I’m not going to lie, I’m disappointed in my luck with this deck. I hope I can find a way to get back on track with Aetherdrift.
