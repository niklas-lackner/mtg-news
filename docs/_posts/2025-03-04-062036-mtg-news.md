In August, Legendary Entertainment (formerly Legendary Pictures) acquired the rights to film, broadcast, and simulcast Magic: The Gathering. It’s a major watershed, not just in the world of card games, but in the world of fantasy films and shows, both on the big screen and on television. The feature film and TV rights are exclusive to Legendary and are being handled by director and producer Peter Jackson, who has directed the seven “Lord of the Rings” films, the “Lord of the Rings” TV series, and “The Hobbit” films. Universal Pictures acquired the rights to Magic’s TV show, and is expected to launch it sometime in the next several months.
