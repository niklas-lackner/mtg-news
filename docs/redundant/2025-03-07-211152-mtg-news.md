The Magic: The Gathering (MTG) movie and TV universe is beginning to wind down. Legendary Entertainment will direct a movie about the game’s “best players” and Hasbro is readying a TV series that will focus on the game’s most popular cards. After adding new “movies” to its portfolio, Hasbro has begun work on its own TV series, a collaboration with Legendary called “Magic: The Gathering: Road to Pro.”
