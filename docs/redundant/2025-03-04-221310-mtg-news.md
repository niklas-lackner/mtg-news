“Magic: The Gathering” is the self-proclaimed “Worlds Greatest Trading Card Game.” It is a game that has gone from four years ago (when it was the world’s first trading card game) to a $500 million business that has spawned products (cards, toys, board games, DVDs, and more) and a multi-billion dollar business. The game’s success has spawned not only its own rich cultural phenomenon, but also the creation of a universe of media and merchandise that has been thriving for nearly a decade.
