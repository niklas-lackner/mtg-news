“Magic: The Gathering,” the trading card game played in basements around the globe since 1993, is set for major film and TV adaptations from Legendary Entertainment and Hasbro. The toy maker and Hollywood mini-major behind the “Godzilla” and “Dune” franchises is teaming up with the game’s publisher, Wizards of the Coast, to produce a franchise that will return the card game to the public eye after a decade in which it has largely been relegated to a niche hobby.
