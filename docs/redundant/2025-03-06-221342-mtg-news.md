“Magic: The Gathering” is a trading card game played in basements around the globe since 1993, but the original game is a little more than a decade old. The game began as a small card game called “Master of the Deck” spawned from a game called “Gambler’s Wager” that was designed for the World Series of Poker. In the early 1990s, the game began to take on a life of its own. The “Gutenberg” version of the game was conceived in 1994, but the game, which has been played by 1 billion players around the world, was first played in 1992. The game was renamed Magic: The Gathering in 1998, and has played as the most popular trading card game in the world ever since.
